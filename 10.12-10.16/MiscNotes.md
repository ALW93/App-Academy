# **Notes**

## **Random Things to Remember**

- Using `()` implicity returns components.
- Role of `index.js` is to _render_ your application.
- The reference to `root` comes from a div in the body of your public html file.
- State of a component is simply a regular JS Object.
- Class Components require `render()` method to return JSX.
- Functional Components directly return JSX.
- `Class` is `className` in React.
- When parsing for an integer just chain `Number.parseInt("123")`
- Use ternary operator if you want to make a conditional inside a fragment.
  ```js
  {
    x === y ? <div>Naisu</div> : <div>Not Naisu</div>;
  }
  ```
- Purpose of `React.Fragment` is to allow you to create groups of children without adding an extra dom element.
