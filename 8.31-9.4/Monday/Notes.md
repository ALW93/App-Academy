## **Whiteboarding Tips and Tricks**

- Companies whiteboard because steps for solving wb problems are almost nearly identical to solving real-world practical situations.
  - They are looking to test a few things:
    - Can you think algorithmically? Think efficiently?
    - Are you a good communicator?
    - Can you code neatly and correctly?

**`Correct Steps`**

1. Repeat and clarify the problem.
2. Identify Edge Cases & I/O.
3. Pseudocode IF NECESSARY.
4. Implement Code.
5. Walk through an example input.
6. Det. Time and Space (Theta).
   - Time is expensive, space is cheap.
   - Ask interviewer is optimization is even necessary.

**`Strategies`**

- Hash Maps.
- Divide and Conquer DP Programming.
- Using Math Properties.
- **`Amortized Analysis`** : Method for analyzing a given algorithm's complexity, or how much a resource, especially time or or memory, it takes to execute.
- Keeping a Stack or Queue on the side to track values.
- Keep two pointers for the same iteration.
- Perform an operation twice.
- Sort the input.
- Approach the problem from the other end.
- Use binary numbers instead of decimal numbers.
- Use binary search instead of incrementation.

**If you have seen the problem before, just tell them you have**.
