# **Notes**

## **Terminal Basics**

**`The terminal`** is a text based system that allows you, as a user, to control your computer and do everything from creating new files and folders to starting up entire applications.

- Mac & Linux use **`The Terminal`**
- Windows uses **`The Command Prompt`**

**Descriptions of Programs we Installed**

- **`VSCODE`** : a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- **`Node`** : an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- **`NPM`** : a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
- **`Mocha`** : a JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs.
- **`Xcode Command Line Tools`** : The Command Line Tool package gives Mac terminal users many commonly used tools, utilities, and compilers
- **`Homebrew`** : a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software.
- **`Python 3`** : an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

## **File Tree**

- **`Directory`** : Same as a folder on your computer; a directory can contain many files or subdirectories (folders within themselves)
- **`Root`** : The outermost main directory of our computer represented by /
- **`Path`** : Location on your computer specified by directories. `/Desktop/photos/cats.pdf` is an example of a path.
- **`CLI`** : The Command Line Interface is the text-based user interface used to view and manage computer files.
  - Predates the GUI, and many coding specific programs can only be run from the CL (such as Node)!
- **`GUI`** : The Graphic User Interface is the visual alternative of the CLI, it is what we have been using to navigate our computers so far.

## **Basic Terminal Navigation**

**Unix** refers to the parent operating system upon which Mac is built on and Linux is inspired by.

- They have _nearly identical_ commands and features.
- The terminal dafaults into **`~`** (**tilde**) which denotes your **`home directory`**.

**Navigation Commands**

- **`ls`** : lists all files and subdirectories in the current directory.
- **`cd [path]`** : changes the current directory to the directory specified by the _path_ argument.
- **`pwd`** : The present working directory command lists the path from your current location starting from root.
- **`clear`** : Clears your terminal.

**Directory Shortcuts**

- You can use **`cd ..`** or **`cd`** by itself to quickly naviagte to your previous directory.
- If you hit **tab** you can auto-complete your submission in the terminal (if there are multiple matches your terminal will list them out for you to choose.)
- You can drag and drop folders from the GUI into the terminal to auto-populate the full path!

## **Using Node JS**

Javascript is the **language of the internet**!

- The two main environments we use to run Javascript are: **`Google Chrome`** & **`Node`**.
- **`Node`** is a very powerful runtime environment built on Google Chrome's Javascript V8 Engine.
- **`Runtime Environment`** : A runtime system that is used to implement portions of an execution model.

**Node REPL vs. Javascript File**

- There are two ways to run Javascript using Node:
  - Using the **`Node REPL`**
    - Used for testing quick ideas.
    - Useful when playing around with curiosities because the expression is evaluated very quickly.
    - Any code you enter into the REPL will be deleted upon exiting.
  - Using Node to run a **`.js file`**
    - Used for saving files for the long term.

**Using the Node REPL**

To enter the Node REPL simply type `node` into your terminal, you will be greeted with a `>` character - here you can type any JS code, and even define functions! (Just keep in mind these will not be saved)

- To exit node, type **`. exit`** or ctrl + c.

**Using Javascript Files**

- Create a folder via Terminal by using **`mkdir <folder name>`**.
- Create a JS file via Terminal by using **`touch <file name.js>`**.
- To run a JS file via Terminal type **`node <file name>`**.

## **Navigating in VSCode**

VCSode is an **IDE** (**`Interactive Developer Environment`**).

> Please keep in mind that keeping an organized file system will save you a lot of trouble in the future!
