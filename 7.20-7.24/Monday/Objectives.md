# **Objectives**

## **Running JS Locally**

- **Match the commands `ls, cd, pwd` to their descriptions**

  - **`ls`** : lists all files and subdirectories in the current directory.
  - **`cd [path]`** : changes the current directory to the directory specified by the _path_ argument.
  - **`pwd`** : The present working directory command lists the path from your current location starting from root.

- **Given a folder structure diagram, a list of 'cd (path)' commands and target files, match the paths to the target files.**

* **Use VSCode to create a folder. Within the folder create a .js file containing console.log('hello new world'); and save it.**

  - To manually create a folder in VSCode, click the 'new folder' button.
  - To create a file within that folder, click on the folder to enter it, and then selected 'new file' to create a file (you can change the type of file it is by appending the correct ext. type)

* **Use node to execute a JavaScript file in the terminal**
  - Type in **`node <fileName.js>`** into your terminal to execute.
