# **Notes**

## **Linked Lists**

- A **`linked list`** represents a linear sequence of 'vertices' or 'nodes' and tracks three properties.
  - **`Head`** : The first node in the list.
  - **`Tail`** : The last node in the list.
  - **`Length`** : The number of nodes in the list; the list's length.
- **`Nodes`** : Simpler, smaller data structure that connects the linked list.
- Node Properties:
  - **`Value`** : THe actual value this node represents.
  - **`Next`** : The next node in the list (relative to this node).
  - **`Previous`** : The previous node in the list (relative to this node).
