# **Objectives**

## **Control Flow & Arrays**

- **Define a function that accepts a sentence string and two words as args. The function should return a boolean indicating if the sentence includes either word.**

  ```js
  function eitherStringIncluded(sentence, word1, word2) {
    return sentence.includes(word1) || sentence.includes(word2) ? true : false;
  }
  ```

- **Identify a pair of mutually exclusive conditions**

  - Heads or Tails
  - True or False
  - Assessment Score >= 80 ? Pass : Fail

- **Given a for loop, translate it into a while loop, and vice-versa**

  ```js
  function aCounter(word) {
    let index = 0;
    let count = 0;
    while (index < word.length) {
      let char = word[index];
      if (char === "a" || char === "A") {
        count += 1;
      }
      index++;
    }
    return count;
  }

  function aCounter(word) {
    word = word.toLowerCase();
    let count = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
      if (word[i] === "a") {
        count++;
        le;
      }
    }
    return count;
  }
  ```

  - Here is a quick drawing of how the delimiters are transferred in between.

- **Write a function that iterates through a provided string argument**

  ```js
  function countVowels(word) {
    const VOWEL = "aeiou";
    let count = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
      if (VOWEL.indexOf(word[i]) > -1) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    return count;
  }
  ```

- **Given a description of pig latin, write a function that takes in a string argument and utilizes String#slice to translate the string into pig latin.**
  ```js
  function pigLatinWord(word) {
    const VOWEL = "aeiou";
    if (VOWEL.indexOf(word[0]) > -1) {
      return word + "yay";
    } else {
      for (var i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        if (VOWEL.indexOf(word[i]) > -1) {
          return word.slice(i) + word.slice(0, i) + "ay";
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Write a function that takes in an array of words and a string as arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is located inside of the array. The function must use Array.indexOf().**

  ```js
  function wordWithinArray(array, word) {
    return array.indexOf(word) > -1 ? true : false;
  }
  ```

- **Define that an array literal is an ordered list of values defined by using bracket and individual values are read by indexing.**

  - The **Array** is a data type that is one of JS's global objects, they are used to store multiple values within a single structure (similar to creating a list).
  - Arrays are zero-indexed.
    ```js
    let arr = ["apple", "pear", "orange"];
    // arr[0] => 'apple'
    // arr[1] => 'pear'
    // arr[2] => orange
    ```

- **Prevent code that can throw an exception from causing the program to crash.**
  - The most important thing to remember when writing while loops is to always be **working towards your condition**, if we omitted the index++ our loop would run infinitely; likely crashing w/e we were working on.
  - **Types of Errors**
    - _FYI: This is not part of the reading/lecture, just a nice to know. _
    - \*_Error_ : Most often used for implementing user defined exceptions.
    - **RangeError** : Generated by numbers that fall outside a specified range.
    - **ReferenceError** : Thrown when a non-existent variable is accessed.
    - **SyntaxError** : Thrown when rules of JS language are broken (i.e. forgetting to close a curly brace)
    - **TypeError** : Occurs when a value is not of the expected type.
    - **URIError** : Thrown by methods such as encodeURI() and decodeURI() when they encounter a malformed URI.
    - **EvalError** : Thrown when the eval() function is used improperly

* In the above list, Reference, Syntax, and Type are seen most frequently.
