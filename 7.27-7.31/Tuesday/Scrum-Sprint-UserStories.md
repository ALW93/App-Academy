# **Scrum Overview**

**"Scrum" Stands for ...Nothing!**

- Scrum is not an acronym, it is a term taken from Rugby that refers to _a method of restarting a game after an accidental infringement, or when the ball has gone out of play_.

**The Standard Scrum Process**

- There is no standardized process in Scrum.

- Scrum is a **`framework`** for organizing and managing work.

- Scrum is the leading contender in the pantheon of certified Agile software development methodologies.

- The flip side is that an organization's "unique practices and special approaches" can pollute the Scrum process.

**The Scrum Practices**

> Scrum is: "_a refreshingly simple, people-centric framework based on the values of honesty, openness, courage, respect, focus, trust, empowerment, and collaboration._"

- There are Four Dimensions to Scrum:
  - The roles of those who participate.
  - The activities in which a team will participate.
  - The artifacts created to manage the process.
  - The rules that bind the interactions of the roles, activities, and artifacts.

**Scrum Roles**

There are three roles in Scrum.

- **The Product Owner**

  - Provides leadership needed to define the product.
  - Decides which features and functionality to build and in which order to build them.
  - Responsible for overall success of the software.
  - They must be available at all times for any questions from the dev. team.

- **The Scrum Master**

  - Helps the team understand and embrace the Scrum values and principles.
  - Provides process leadership.
  - Maintains productivity, and helps to remove roadblocks.
  - Acts as a leader, not a manager.

- **The Development Team**
  - Typically ranges from five to ten people per development team.
  - Large companies will have multiple pods of these dev teams.

**Scrum Activities & Scrum Artifacts**

Activites of a Scrum Team are simple to list and cycle over and over again.

1. Product owner has a vision of what needs to be created.

2. They take the vision and break it down into a list of features to add to a **`backlog`**.

3. Product owner manages the backlog through a process called **`grooming`** that leaves the list in a prioritized order.

4. Dev process begins with **`Spring Planning`**, where the team forecasts how many features they will be able to complete in a set amount of time.

5. **`daily scrum`** is an adaptive planning activity where team members help coordinate their work through am inspection & synchronization.

6. Sprint is completed with two introspection and adaptation activities: **`show and tell`** and **`sprint retrospective`**.

**The Product Backlog**

While in maintenance mode of an on-going project, the backlog will include:

- New Features
- Changes to Existing Features
- Bugs
- Fixes to Technical Debt
- Etc.

**Sprints**

- Sprints can be for up to a month.
- The work completed after every spring should create something of _tangible value_.
- Sprints are always **`timeboxed`** so they always have a fixed start and end date.
- New sprints will always follow the completion of an old sprint.

**Sprint Planning**

- Goal is to agree on what the upcoming sprint is supposed to achieve.
- Agree on a sustainable pace.
- **`Sprint Backlog`** : Second backlog that includes breakdown of tasks for targeted features and associated backlogs.

**Running the Sprint**

- **Daily Scrum**
  - **Daily Scrum/Daily Stand-Up** : 15 min. meeting held in the am where each team member answers three questions:
    - What did I accomplish yesterday?
    - What do I hope to accomplish today?
    - What obstacles or impediments prevent me from making progress?

**Done**

- Sprint results should be **"shippable"** meaning the team needs to define what their definition of "done" is.

**Show and Tell**

- Opportunity to see what everyone on the team has created.
- The most important part is the conversation that ensues after presentation.
- Successful review results in information flowing in both directions.
- It is a scheduled opportunity to inspect and adapt the product.

**Sprint Retrospective**

- Time taken to dicuss what is not working with all of the development practices.

**Then it all repeats!**
